title: Clubs temporarily disabled
---

The day after releasing Clubs, we made an [open call for feedback](https://civitai.com/articles/3636/call-for-feedback-on-sustainable-community-development) about how to help make the community sustainable in a way that works.

We received your feedback loud and clear about the perceived dangers of what a program like Clubs could lead to and have disabled them while they get a full rework.

Aspects of the clubs system have obvious pro's such as serving as a gathering place for like-minded community engagement and creator support, however it was clear Clubs in its current form was the wrong way to implement it. Instead, Clubs will become user led sections of the site where users can freely share their resources, content  and ideas (think Sub-Reddits on Reddit). Meanwhile we'll be introducing other, more transparent ways for creators to get support from their fans.

If you're already a member of a club you'll be refunded your Buzz spent in full, if you bought Buzz that was then spent on a club membership you can contact us at support@civitai.com for a refund. 

We love this community and hope to share our plans to better it in the next few days.
